# *react-around-auth: My seventh project at TripleTen*  
This project extends the *around-react project* by implementing an Authorization feature. Before being able to access the main page (a location card display), users must first create a profile and sign-in with their email addresses and chosen passwords.

The project is now used as the Frontend Build for the Full-Stack [react-around-api-full](https://github.com/frederickjodozi/react-around-api-full) App and needs to be connected to a Backend for development.

## *Features*
Here are the App's main features relating to user authorization:
- A Protected Route component that protects the App's Main view and redirects the user to the sign-in page.
- The use of a JSON Web Token for Authorization. 
- An isLoggedIn state variable that unlocks the App's Main view upon token reception.
- The use of the localStorage object for token and data storing.
- Register and Login form components to handle authorization.

## *Contributions*
This project can be used by people beginning to learn React and more specifically user authorization. It can be cloned on a local machine for studying and/or editing, and relevant pull requests will be accepted!  

Since this project is used as a Frontend build for the Full-Stack [react-around-api-full](https://github.com/frederickjodozi/react-around-api-full) App, I will leave a link to it down below. I recommend using the Full-Stack App (the last link) instead of the one published on Github Pages.  

**Again, many thanks to TripleTen for providing me with the materials and instructions to build this project!**
